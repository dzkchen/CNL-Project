## Background

As technology advances to embrace Artificial Intelligence (AI), data centres have become major energy consumers. To provide the energy output demanded by data centres, alternative energy-production options need to be considered. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are at the forefront of these conversations, with multiple designs being developed to address these energy needs. The Darlington New Nuclear Project is an SMR project under construction in Ontario and is expected to become the first grid-scale SMR in the G7. Construction began in May 2025, with completion expected by the end of the decade and connection to the electricity grid expected by the end of 2030.

The Darlington project uses the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 boiling water reactor (BWR). The BWR uses nuclear fission to turn water into steam, which goes directly to a turbine to create electricity. Construction of the four planned units is expected to create up to 18,000 jobs. Their construction, operation, and maintenance are expected to add $38.5 billion to Canada's GDP over 65 years. Together, the four units will provide 1,200 megawatts of electricity, enough to power approximately 1.2 million homes.

For a broader view of SMR design, see the [OECD-NEA SMR Dashboard](https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2025-09/web_-_smr_dashboard_-_third_edition.pdf) and the [IAEA ARIS SMR Catalogue](https://aris.iaea.org/Publications/SMR_catalogue_2024.pdf). Both give a sense of the variety of SMR designs being developed internationally. You can find the BWRX-300 on page 134 of the OECD Dashboard and page 17 of the IAEA Catalogue.


## Your Mission
In this challenge, your team has been invited to build a solution to improve SMRs in some way. You may extend the supplied code and hardware designs, combine ideas from several sub-problems, or create a related solution of your own. Your solution should be catered towards a real SMR - the BWRX-300 or any other you may be interested in.

As this is an interdisciplinary challenge, solutions should combine scientific thinking and engineering
design. Your solutions can take many forms, including a Prototype, a Model, a Proposal, an Experiment, a Simulation, Literature Review etc. The
balance between science and engineering can vary in the solutions as long as a threshold of
20% engineering and 20% science is surpassed. Please ensure that the Engineering work and Science work in each solution complement each other - that they are truly interdependent.  Your output by the end of the weekend should convince the judges that your solution is impactful, feasible,  and safe.

As you make your solution this weekend, use the  [judging criteria](#judging-criteria) to guide your decisions and demonstration.

#### Team Formation 

Your team should comprise of 3-5 students with a close-to even split between students from the Science Faculty and students from the Engineering Faculty.

## Sub-Problems

### [Controls and Instrumentation](Controls%20and%20Instrumentation/)

Modern energy systems rely on sensors, controllers, and safety systems to operate reliably. In nuclear power plants, instrumentation and control systems help monitor reactor power, temperature, coolant conditions, and control rod movement to keep the system stable and safe.

This challenge invites students to develop or improve a control and instrumentation solution for an SMR-inspired system. Teams may build on one of the supported solutions, create something new from scratch, or develop something inspired by the supported solutions without directly extending them.

Projects may take the form of software, hardware, experiments, simulations, data analysis, or research. Solutions should explore how measurements, control decisions, physical behaviour, and human operators interact when sensors are noisy, disturbances occur, components fail, or safety limits are approached.

### [Leak Detection and Cleanup](Leak%20Detection%20and%20Cleanup/)

A big concern in any nuclear facility is quickly detecting leaks. SMRs face additional concerns compared to traditional reactors because of their different geometry and narrow form factor.

This challenge invites students to develop a system capable of autonomously detecting, localizing, and reporting radiation leaks in SMR facilities. Solutions may also include methods for monitoring contamination spread and supporting cleanup operations.

### [Reactor Design Optimization](Reactor%20Design%20Optimization/)

SMRs are a relatively new technology that have some advantages over traditional nuclear reactors, but also some disadvantages. A major part of designing SMRs is optimizing their design to minimize their disadvantages and maximize their advantages. There are many parts of a reactor that can affect efficiency, cost, and feasibility of the design. Reactor performance depends on design choices such as fuel rod geometry and material selection, and operating choices such as control rod movement, coolant flow, steam flow, and startup strategy.

This challenge invites students to use physics and engineering principles to model a reactor that is efficient, economical, and practical for deployment. Solutions should explore trade-offs among fuel design, reactor performance, lifecycle cost, and operational constraints. Teams may focus on reactor design optimization, reactor operation optimization, or a combination of both. The goal is to improve performance while considering safety limits, power output, fuel lifetime, cost, and overall system efficiency.

Participants are encouraged to build tools, simulations, dashboards, or algorithms that compare design choices, tune operating strategies, or automatically search for better solutions.

### [Security](Security/)

Nuclear facilities are highly critical locations that require extremely strict security measures to prevent sabotage. Nuclear facilities integrate multi-layered security protocols and policies to protect the premises from bad actors. SMR facilities may need to diverge from the traditional reactor structure, which may introduce new security concerns.

This challenge asks teams to design access-control policies, detection strategies, and response workflows that safeguard vital areas, detect unauthorized removal of radiological material, and mitigate insider or external threats without causing excessive nuisance alarms or operational paralysis.
