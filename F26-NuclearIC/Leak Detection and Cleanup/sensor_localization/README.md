# Sensor Localization Challenge

Welcome to the Sensor Localization Challenge. This repository provides a baseline hardware and software setup designed to estimate the position of a localized vibration source (such as a leak) along a physical structure using accelerometer sensors and real-time signal processing.

The baseline implementation uses an **ESP32-C6** microcontroller with two **BMX160** sensors connected over I2C. It calculates instantaneous vibration magnitudes relative to a rolling baseline, streams the data over serial to a host machine, and estimates the relative position percentage using peak selection and linear interpolation.

> **Alternative hardware:** The same setup can also be built with an **Arduino UNO R4 Minima** and two **MMA7361** analog accelerometers read through the ADC. Starter code is not provided for this configuration but the provided code can be adapted with minor changes. The localization method and objectives stay the same.

> Key differences to account for:
> * Read each sensor's X, Y, and Z outputs with `analogRead()` on pins A0–A5 instead of using the I2C library.
> * Convert the ADC reading to acceleration using the MMA7361's zero-g offset and sensitivity ([see its datasheet](https://www.openimpulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/downloadables/Triple-Axis-Accelerometer-Module-MMA7361L-Datasheet.pdf)).
> * Tie each sensor's **SL** pin to 3.3V (otherwise the chip stays asleep) and **GS** to GND for the ±1.5 g range.
> * Redo the calibration (`NO_VIB_THRESHOLD` and `CALIBRATION`), since the MMA7361 produces different values than the BMX160.
> * In the Python scripts, update `PORT`, the plot's y-axis limit in `sensor_location.py`, and the `total > 30` threshold in `median.py` to suit the MMA7361's signal levels.

## Setup and Execution Guide

Follow these steps to configure the hardware, upload the firmware, and run the real-time Python localization dashboard:

### Step 1: Hardware Wiring and Connections

![Hardware Wiring Setup](images/hardware_setup.png)

The system uses two separate I2C hardware buses on an ESP32 microcontroller to read two BMX160 sensors sharing the same default I2C address (`0x68`):

| Sensor | ESP32 Bus | SDA Pin | SCL Pin | Clock Speed | I2C Address |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sensor 1** | `Wire` (Bus 0) | GPIO 23 | GPIO 22 | 400 kHz | `0x68` |
| **Sensor 2** | `Wire1` (Bus 1) | GPIO 6 | GPIO 7 | 400 kHz | `0x68` |

Connect VCC to 3.3V and GND to common ground on the microcontroller.

### Step 2: Firmware Compilation and Upload
1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Set the board to **ESP32C6 Dev Module** under **Tools > Board**.
3. Install required Arduino libraries via the Library Manager (`Ctrl + Shift + I`):
   * `DFRobot_BMX160` (by DFRobot)
   * `RunningAverage` (by Rob Tillaart)
   * `Wire` (Standard ESP32 library)
4. Open [`read_sensors/accelerometer/accelerometer.ino`](read_sensors/accelerometer/accelerometer.ino).
5. Connect the ESP32 via USB, select the correct port in **Tools > Port**, and upload the sketch.
6. Open the Serial Monitor at **115200 baud** to verify sensor initialization (`Both sensors are initialized`).

### Step 3: Python Environment Setup
Install the necessary Python packages on your host system:

```bash
pip install pyserial numpy matplotlib
```

### Step 4: Launch Real-Time Localization

1. Open [`sensor_location/sensor_location.py`](sensor_location/sensor_location.py).
2. Set the `PORT` variable to match your connected serial port (e.g., `PORT = "COM11"` on Windows or `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux/macOS).
3. Run the tracking script from the sensor_localization folder:
```bash
python sensor_location/sensor_location.py
```
4. A live Matplotlib interface will display real-time sensor amplitude streams, calculated differential values, peak usage statistics, and the estimated position percentage.

## Calibration and Threshold Configuration

Before collecting evaluation measurements, calibrate the system for your specific test rig and vibration source:

### 1. Noise Floor Threshold (`NO_VIB_THRESHOLD`)

* Observe raw sensor outputs when no vibration is present.
* Update `NO_VIB_THRESHOLD = 70` in [`sensor_location.py`](sensor_location/sensor_location.py). Samples where combined signal strength (`sensor1 + sensor2`) falls below this value are discarded as background noise.

### 2. Physical Reference Calibration

1. Mark fixed positions along your structure (e.g., 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%).
2. Place the vibration source at each position for several seconds to generate text logs of `v1,v2` output.
3. Run [`sensor_location/calibration/median.py`](sensor_location/calibration/median.py) on each position file to extract the median signal differential (`sensor1 - sensor2`):
```bash
python sensor_location/calibration/median.py
```


4. Update the arrays in [`sensor_location.py`](sensor_location/sensor_location.py) with your measured values:
```python
CALIBRATION = [-1000.12, -300.37, -123.19, -60.0, 2.475, 454.2]
CAL_POSITIONS = [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
```

## Project Overview

This repository provides a baseline foundation for vibration-based fault localization. Participants are encouraged to modify the hardware setup, test alternative structural mediums, or refine signal processing algorithms.

### Extension Ideas

* **Multi-Dimensional Localization:** Extend the 1D setup to 2D plates or 3D pipe networks by adding additional sensor nodes.
* **Alternative Sensor Hardware:** Test piezoelectric sensors, acoustic microphones, or optical sensors instead of accelerometers.
* **Advanced Signal Processing:** Replace linear interpolation with Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), cross-correlation, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), or machine learning classification models.
* **Hardware Integration:** Move signal filtering and location calculations directly onto the edge microcontroller to reduce host processing dependencies.

## Baseline System Output

The plots below illustrate baseline performance across different source positions:

### Source Position: Far Left (100%)

![alt text](images/100.png)

Vibration amplitude is highest at Sensor 1, producing a large negative differential that maps to 0%.

### Source Position: Middle (~42%)

![alt text](images/42.png)

Vibration levels are balanced across both sensors, resulting in a small signal differential near center position.

### Source Position: Far Right (0%)

![alt text](images/0.png)

Vibration amplitude dominates at Sensor 2, generating a large positive differential that maps to 100%.

## Technical Details and System Architecture

### Hardware Diagram and Data Flow

### Microcontroller Processing ([`accelerometer.ino`](read_sensors/accelerometer/accelerometer.ino))

1. **Sensor Initialization:** Sets accelerometer range to $\pm 2g$ (`BMX160_ACC_RANGE_2G`) for maximum vibration sensitivity and output data rate to 100 Hz (`BMX160_ACC_CONF_100HZ`).
2. **Vector Magnitude Calculation:** Computes total acceleration magnitude for each sensor:

$$\text{mag} = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2}$$


3. **Rolling Baseline Subtraction:** Maintains a 20-sample running average (`RunningAverage.h`) to subtract ambient gravity vectors and compute dynamic vibration amplitude:

$$\text{vib} = |\text{mag} - \text{average}(\text{mag})|$$


4. **Data Transmission:** Streams comma-separated `vib1,vib2` strings over serial at 115200 baud with a 20ms loop delay (~50 Hz sample rate).

### Host Signal Processing ([`sensor_location.py`](sensor_location/sensor_location.py))

1. **Rolling Buffers:** Stores incoming streams in a 200-sample plotting queue and a 50-sample (~1 second) calculation window (`AVG_WINDOW = 50`).
2. **Threshold & Peak Selection:** Filters out ambient noise where `vib1 + vib2 <= NO_VIB_THRESHOLD` and selects the $K=20$ strongest samples (`TOP_K = 20`) in the rolling window.
3. **Differential & Interpolation:** Calculates the mean value of selected peak samples for each sensor, computes `diff = {avg\_v1} - {avg\_v2}`, and performs 1D piecewise linear interpolation (`np.interp`) against sorted calibration points.
